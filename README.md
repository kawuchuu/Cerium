# ProJshMod
A Discord moderation bot that's in very early stages.
# Is it useable at the moment?
Not really. It doesn't have many commands. Remember, it's in very early stages. I started the project not too long ago.
# Known Bugs
- If you bulk delete messages with `mod:delete`, the number of messages that it deleted will also add the command you just entered. For example, if you typed in `mod:delete 5`, it will tell you it deleted 6 messages instead of 5. (the command will work though)
